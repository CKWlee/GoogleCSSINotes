###Intro to Realtime Database Part. 2

##Objectives

You will learn to:

Use the DOM to capture user input.
Use the Firebase API to write data to your realtime database.
Use the Firebase console as the source of truth for database operations.

##Instructions

Start off by adding a function to writeMessage.js to write logic to send a message to the database. Run firebase emulators:start --only hosting. This will start the emulators so that you can test your project.

const submitMessage = () => {

}

Use console.log() to confirm that our script file is properly linked to our HTML.

Add a click handler to the “Send Message” button. Then test the submitMessage() function again.

Use the DOM again to capture input from our form.

Use the Firebase API to push our data to the realtime database.
